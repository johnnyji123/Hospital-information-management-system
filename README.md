# Hospital Information Management System (HIMS)
### Developed using Python, the system leverages the Flask web framework for seamless HTTP request handling, and MySQL serves as the relational database to elegantly manage the complex network of patient records.
### Technologies used:
### Features:
* The HIMS creates a dedicated database from scratch to store patient information securely.
* Users can add/register new patients, providing essential details such as name, contact information, and medical history.
* The system allows users to view specific patient information coded based on Patient_ID as primary key. This feature enables quick access to individual patient records.
* Users have the capability to update patient information, ensuring that the records are always current and accurate.
  
### Python for Backend Logic:
* Python used for my backend logic, handling operations such as data manipulation and algorithmic processes
* Flask was used  to create endpoints and routes, effectively managing the interaction between the user and the backend functions.
* SQL was utilized for various database operations, including table and database creation, as well as executing queries to create, add, and update my database (done on back end).
* MySQL serves as the database system, efficiently storing and retrieving patient information, ensuring the integrity and accessibility of data.
* HTML was used to structure the frontend, creating input forms and user interfaces for a straightforward and user-friendly experience.
